## Overview
This project presents a real-time AI-powered interactive projection platform that transforms public spaces into collaborative digital murals. Community members submit text prompts which are instantly transformed into AI-generated visuals or animated procedural graphics and projected onto large walls during nighttime events.

The system explores how Generative AI can facilitate collective creativity, increase public engagement, and foster inclusive, intergenerational participation in shared digital experiences.
